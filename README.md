# Object-detection (YOLOv8)
YOLOv8 is the newest model in the YOLO algorithm series â€“ the most well-known family of object detection and classification models in the
Computer Vision (CV) field. With the latest version, the YOLO legacy lives on by providing state-of-the-art results for image or video analytics, with
an easy-to-implement framework

YOLOv8 is widely used in self-driving cars for real-time object detection. It helps in identifying and tracking various objects on the road, such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and traffic lights, enabling the car to make
informed decisions and navigate safely
